# Immediate Actions Required

## ðŸš¨ Critical Fix Applied
The Netlify build failure has been resolved with updated `netlify.toml` configuration.

## ðŸ“‹ What You Need To Do Right Now

### 1. Update GitHub Repository
Since we have authentication issues with git push, please manually update the repository:

#### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://github.com/patriotnewsactivism/whisper
2. Navigate to the `netlify.toml` file
3. Click "Edit this file"
4. Replace the entire content with:

```toml
[build]
  base = "client"
  command = "npx vite build"
  publish = "dist"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

5. Click "Commit changes"

#### Method 2: Local Git with Authentication
```bash
# If you have GitHub CLI installed
gh auth login
cd /path/to/whisper
git add netlify.toml
git commit -m "fix: Update Netlify build configuration"
git push origin feature/enhanced-v2-clean
```

### 2. Configure Netlify Build Settings
In your Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to Site Settings â†’ Build & Deploy
2. Update these settings:
   - **Build command**: `npx vite build`
   - **Publish directory**: `client/dist`
   - **Base directory**: `client`

### 3. Set Environment Variables
In Netlify â†’ Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables, add:

**Required for transcription services:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ELEVATEAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

**Required for monetization:**
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url
```

### 4. Test the Fix
After updating the configuration:
1. Go to Netlify â†’ Deploys
2. Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"
3. Monitor the build logs for success

## âœ… Expected Result
After these changes, your build should succeed with output similar to:
```
vite v5.4.20 building for production...
âœ“ 31 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                   0.40 kB â”‚ gzip: 0.27 kB

dist/assets/index-XXXXXX.js    149.40 kB â”‚ gzip: 48.05 kB
âœ“ built in 535ms
```
