# Client-Side Implementation for Whisper Transcriber

This directory contains a client-side implementation of the Whisper Transcriber application that makes API calls directly to OpenAI without requiring a server-side component. This implementation is provided as a backup solution in case the server-side implementation continues to experience 400/500 errors.

## Key Features

- Direct API calls to OpenAI's Whisper API
- User-provided API key (stored in browser's localStorage)
- Toggle between client-side and server-side modes
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- All the same functionality as the server-side version

## How to Use

### 1. Switch to Client-Side Implementation

To switch to the client-side implementation, rename the files:

```bash
# Backup original files
mv client/src/App.jsx client/src/App.server.jsx
mv client/src/styles.css client/src/styles.server.css
mv client/src/main.jsx client/src/main.server.jsx

# Use client-side implementation
mv client/src/App.client.jsx client/src/App.jsx
mv client/src/styles.client.css client/src/styles.css
mv client/src/main.client.jsx client/src/main.jsx
```

### 2. Build and Deploy

Build and deploy the application as usual:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. User Instructions

When using the client-side implementation:

1. Users will need to provide their own OpenAI API key
2. The API key is stored in the browser's localStorage for convenience
3. Users can toggle between client-side and server-side modes
4. All transcription processing happens directly between the user's browser and OpenAI

## Security Considerations

- The API key is stored in the user's browser using localStorage
- API calls are made directly from the user's browser to OpenAI
- No API keys are sent to your server
- This implementation eliminates server-side API key management

## Advantages of Client-Side Implementation

1. **Eliminates Server-Side Errors**: No more 400/500 errors from your server
2. **Reduced Server Load**: Processing happens between user and OpenAI
3. **No API Key Management**: Users provide their own keys
4. **Simplified Architecture**: No need for server-side functions

## Disadvantages

1. **User Experience**: Users need to provide their own API key
2. **Cost Management**: Each user uses their own API credits
3. **Support Complexity**: Users may need help with API key issues

## Switching Back to Server-Side

If you resolve the server-side issues, you can switch back by reversing the file renaming process:

```bash
# Backup client-side files
mv client/src/App.jsx client/src/App.client.jsx
mv client/src/styles.css client/src/styles.client.css
mv client/src/main.jsx client/src/main.client.jsx

# Restore server-side implementation
mv client/src/App.server.jsx client/src/App.jsx
mv client/src/styles.server.css client/src/styles.css
mv client/src/main.server.jsx client/src/main.jsx
```
