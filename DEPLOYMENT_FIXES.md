# Netlify Build Fixes Applied

## Issue Identified
The Netlify build was failing with error: "Could not resolve entry module 'index.html'"

## Root Cause
The build configuration was trying to run `vite build` from the root directory, but the client code is located in the `/client` subdirectory.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  base = "client"
  command = "npx vite build"
  publish = "dist"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 2. Configuration Details
- **base**: Set to "client" to ensure build runs from client directory
- **command**: Changed to "npx vite build" to use npx for compatibility
- **publish**: Set to "dist" (relative to base directory)

### 3. Verified Local Build
- Successfully ran `npm run build` in client directory
- Build completed in 535ms with proper output to dist/

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to GitHub
2. Push to trigger new Netlify build
3. Monitor build logs for any new issues
