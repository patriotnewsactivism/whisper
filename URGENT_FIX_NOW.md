# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX - API Returning HTML Instead of JSON

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Identified**
The error "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'... is not valid JSON" means:
- The API endpoint is returning HTML (404 page) instead of JSON
- The function is not being found at the expected URL
- There's a routing or deployment issue

## âœ… **IMMEDIATE FIX**

### **Problem**: Frontend is calling wrong endpoint
The frontend is likely calling `/transcribe` but the working endpoint is `/transcribe` or the function isn't deployed.

### **Solution 1: Check Deployment**
1. **Verify your Netlify site is deployed**
2. **Check Functions tab** in Netlify dashboard
3. **Ensure functions are deployed** and showing up

### **Solution 2: Fix Frontend Endpoint**
The frontend might be calling the wrong URL. Let me check and fix it.
